# ableton-theme-generator

Turns palettes generated by 'seaborn' into Ableton templates.

The naive approach would be to replace all the colors in order, but that results in sloppy contrast between 
different Ableton UI elements. Instead, this script takes a default template and sorts the elements by their
perceptual brightness (HSP colorspace). It then applies the palettes in this order. End result is that the
template's contrast carries over and the UI elements look right together.

This works with any palette, but the "Sequential" tend to look best IMO.
